# P2-Analyzing-the-NYC-subway-dataset

For this project we will explore the NYC subway dataset to achieve the following goals :

     1. Analyze if more people ride the subway when it is raining versus when it is not raining.
     2. Predict the number of entries using linear regression
     3. Explore the dataset using data visualization
     
The dataset can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1lpoeh2w6px4diu/improved-dataset.zip?dl=0). It includes information about ridership and also weather.
